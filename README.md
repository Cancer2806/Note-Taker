## Installation Notes  

  The package can be cloned (maintaining the file directory structure) and deployed through node (node server.js) to Heroku hosting service   


## Usage 

  The application initially opens to a landing page, with a button to take the User to the Note taking page.  Once through to the Note taking page, existing notes will be displayed in the left hand column of the screen.  New notes are added by pressing the new icon (+) in the navigation bar and then entering the notes.  A note consists of a title and body text where details can be entered.  Once body text has been entered, a save icon will appear in the navigation bar - simply click on this to save the Note.  The new note will appear at the top of the list of notes in the left hand column.  To review the details (body text) of an existing note, click on the note in the left hand column.  To delete a note, click on the trashcan icon adjacent to the note in the left hand column.  The application is deployed at: https://notetaker021.herokuapp.com/  


## Credits
